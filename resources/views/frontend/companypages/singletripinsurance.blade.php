                  <p style="margin: 0;color: #666; font-weight:bold;">The excess amount from the policy holder helps the insurance company to protect itself from non-diversifiable risk. Hence, the insurance company holds less insolvency risk which in turn is a relief for the policy holder. Whereas, in non-par policies insurance companies charge premiums that are estimated to meet expenses only and the premiums are lower than par policies. All the values associated with the policy are determined before the policy is issued for the life of the contract and cannot be altered later and the insurance company bears all the risks of future performance. However, par policies shall end up costing less than non-par policies if maintained long-term. Essentially, with participating whole life policies a risk does exist, but this risk is relatively insignificant.</p>

         <p>If you are interested in getting some type of international insurance coverage during your stay or during an international program, you should strongly consider applying for insurance before leaving to attend a new international program or internship. Preparing for the worst case scenario in making sure that your visa standards or admission requirements can be upheld is important. As the cost of being an international student is often considerably higher, it is important to protect yourself for the future and make sure that you have the greatest chance of success in completing an international program while living reasonably in a foreign country. Contact an insurance provider today for more information on the costs and insurance coverage programs available for your current situation. For one flat rate fee for your program or one ongoing monthly fee during your program, you could be covered for any type of medical emergency or travel emergency in a foreign country.</p>
